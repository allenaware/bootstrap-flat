  <p class="lead">Bootstrap Flat is downloadable in two forms, within which you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common resources and providing both compiled and minified variations.</p>

  <div class="callout callout-warning" id="jquery-required">
    <h4>jQuery required</h4>
    <p>Please note that <strong>all JavaScript plugins require jQuery</strong> to be included, as shown in the <a href="#template">starter template</a>. <a href="{{ site.repo }}/blob/v{{ site.current_version }}/bower.json">Consult our <code>bower.json</code></a> to see which versions of jQuery are supported.</p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="whats-included-precompiled">Precompiled Bootstrap Flat</h2>
  <p>Once downloaded, unzip the compressed folder to see the structure of (the compiled) Bootstrap Flat. You'll see something like this:</p>
<!-- NOTE: This info is intentionally duplicated in the README.
Copy any changes made here over to the README too. -->
{% highlight bash %}
bootstrap/
+-- css/
|   +-- bootstrap-flat.css
|   +-- bootstrap-flat.css.map
|   +-- bootstrap-flat.min.css
|   +-- bootstrap-flat-extras.css
|   +-- bootstrap-flat-extras.css.map
|   +-- bootstrap-flat-extras.min.css
+-- js/
|   +-- bootstrap-flat.js
|   +-- bootstrap-flat.min.js
{% endhighlight %}
<!-- NOTE: This info is intentionally duplicated in the README.

  <p>This is the most basic form of Bootstrap Flat: precompiled files for quick drop-in usage in nearly any web project. We provide compiled CSS and JS (<code>bootstrap-flat.*</code>), as well as compiled and minified CSS and JS (<code>bootstrap-flat.min.*</code>). CSS <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/css-preprocessors">source maps</a> (<code>bootstrap-flat.*.map</code>) are available for use with certain browsers' developer tools.</p>

  <h2 id="whats-included-source">Bootstrap Flat source code</h2>
  <p>The Bootstrap Flat source code download includes the precompiled CSS, and JavaScript, along with source Less, JavaScript, and documentation. More specifically, it includes the following and more:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
bootstrap/
+-- less/
+-- css/
{% endhighlight %}
  <p>The <code>less/</code> is the source code for our CSS, JS, and icon fonts (respectively). The <code>css/</code> folder includes everything listed in the precompiled download section above. Beyond that, any other included file provides support for packages, license information, and development.</p>
